# Small model turns inside Haskell

Use ordinary Haskell for deterministic work and Jev for a compact semantic
choice. Use `Tidepool.Model` when a bounded piece of work needs several tool
calls and a generated answer, while the surrounding Haskell program keeps
ownership of the workflow. Use an actor when it needs an ongoing mailbox,
independent lifecycle or delegated implementation.

`Coordination.hs` is the executable source of four seeds: route a change from
actual diff evidence, clarify a dependency with its owner, prepare an evidenced
handoff, and inspect retained failure output. Supply project-specific callbacks;
only those tools are available. Keep important authority in the callback owner.
The examples deliberately expose no shell or rerun operation.

Build a reusable `textTurn` or `typedTurn`, then call `invokeModel turn input`.
Tool records, argument/result schemas and optional after-tool hooks are the same
`AgentSpec` surface. This initial adapter accepts JSON function tools with object
inputs; raw custom tools and scalar inputs are refused before provider admission.
Use small records for arguments. A typed result may contain nullable fields,
numbers and disjoint tagged alternatives. Unsupported schemas fail preflight.

Match `modelOutcome`, retain `modelReceipt`, and handle a budget failure as an
ordinary result before running cleanup. The invocation receipt contains evidence
references and measured usage; it does not flood the notebook with a transcript.
A hook may prune only the exact retained output handle it receives.

The effect is opt-in and requires the admitted cell service. These seeds are not
advertised in the always-loaded prompts until that engine hook passes joined
acceptance; see `plans/model-call-integration-handoff.md`. They have native Haskell
compile coverage; native contract tests execute callbacks in the caller effect
row. This is separate from resident/JIT and live-provider acceptance.
