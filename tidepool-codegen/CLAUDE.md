# tidepool-codegen — Cranelift JIT compiler + effect machine

Compiles `CoreExpr` to Cranelift-backed state machines and drives the effect
machine at the JIT↔Rust boundary. See the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` for the project
map and locked decisions.

## Diagnostics — JIT runtime / effect machine / cache

Env-gated, OFF by default. The Rust JIT-runtime traces use `log` + `env_logger`
(per-subsystem `tidepool::*` targets) driven by `RUST_LOG`. The legacy
`TIDEPOOL_TRACE*`/`TIDEPOOL_FP_DEBUG` vars are still honored as back-compat
aliases (mapped in `tidepool_codegen::debug::init_logging`). Example:
`RUST_LOG=tidepool::calls=trace,tidepool::heap=trace`.

For the Haskell-extract knobs (a separate process: `DUMP_CLOSED`, `VARID_AUDIT`,
`JOINREC_DEBUG`, `IFACE_DEBUG`) see `haskell/CLAUDE.md`.

| Knob | Layer | What it shows | Reach for it when |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| `RUST_LOG=tidepool::calls=trace` (legacy `TIDEPOOL_TRACE=calls`) | JIT runtime | Every closure call: name, arg, result (`src/debug.rs`) | Tracing which function received/returned a bad value (e.g. wrong type at a case dispatch) |
| `RUST_LOG=tidepool::heap=trace` (legacy `TIDEPOOL_TRACE=heap`) | JIT runtime | `calls`+`scope` + heap-object validation before use | Suspected heap corruption / bad pointer breadcrumbs |
| `RUST_LOG=tidepool::effects=debug` (legacy `TIDEPOOL_TRACE_EFFECTS=1`) | Effect machine | Effect dispatch at the JIT↔Rust boundary | Effect results arriving wrong / lazy-result suspicion |
| `TIDEPOOL_LAZY_RESULTS=0` | Effect machine | Kill-switch: disables lazy effect results (typed Stream/List channel) | Bisecting whether a bug is in the lazy-results path |
| `RUST_LOG=tidepool::fp=debug` (legacy `TIDEPOOL_FP_DEBUG=1`) | Runtime cache | Binary-fingerprint memo keys + sidecar hit/miss (`tidepool-runtime/src/cache.rs`) | Stale-cache suspicion. Note: kernel ctime has ~3ms granularity — sub-tick writes legitimately memo-hit |
| `NONCE=<x>` / `FORCE=1` | `repro313` test | Cache-busting fresh compile / forces Int result inside the user continuation | Re-running the #313 regression gate against a fresh compile |

Always-on breadcrumbs (`[CASE TRAP]`, `[BUG]` bad-pointer lines on stderr) stay
unconditional: they fire only on actual compiler bugs, which must be loud. If you
see one, that's a reportable codegen bug, not user error.

**SIGILL = case trap, not a missing primop.** All `PrimOpKind` variants are
implemented (the `_ =>` catch-all is unreachable). SIGILL crashes come from
Cranelift `trap user2` instructions emitted for exhausted/empty case branches:
when a case encounters a value matching no branch it hits the trap → `ud2` →
SIGILL. Root cause varies (constructor tag mismatch, unexpected value shape).
