# Conflict ledger — realm-spike lane

This lane was launched deliberately overlapping the extract wave's runtime
territory to measure what merge conflicts actually cost (Inanna, 2026-08-08:
"a test to see if we're being too timid about merge conflicts"). The ledger is
a first-class deliverable — the experiment's data, not bookkeeping.

## Recording rule

One row per rebase/fold conflict, however boring. A fold that produced ZERO
conflicts is also recorded (as a zero-row entry with the branch and the files
it touched) — "no conflict" is the measurement, not the absence of one.

Stop-and-ask applies only when a resolution would DROP a side's behavior.
Mechanical resolutions are logged and moved past.

| # | when | operation | file | hunk shape | resolution | minutes | side dropped? |
|---|------|-----------|------|------------|------------|---------|---------------|

## Zero-conflict folds

| # | when | operation | branch | files touched | note |
|---|------|-----------|--------|---------------|------|

## Running tally

- Conflicting folds: 0
- Zero-conflict folds: 0
- Total resolution minutes: 0
- Sides dropped: 0
